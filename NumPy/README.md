This is a series of Jupyter Notebooks of me working through https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/numpy-working-with-multidimensional-data.<br>
These Notebooks are basically my way of remembering all the content.

I'm <span style="color:red">NOT</span> affiliated with Pluralsight, I just found the course useful.

If you're interested in NumPy, check it out.

Going through the process of working through the examples will probably help you learn the content quickly.
