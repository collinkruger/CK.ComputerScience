This is a collection of "Recipe" style Jupyter Notebooks that are basically my way of remembering how to perform varying ML/Data Science tasks using scikit-learn.

Most (if not all) of what is captured here started in Python Machine Learning (3rd Edition) by Sebastian Raschka & Vahid Mirjalili, or scikit-learn documentation.

All notebooks were created in a "default" Anaconda environment [https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on Windows, using Python 3.9.
